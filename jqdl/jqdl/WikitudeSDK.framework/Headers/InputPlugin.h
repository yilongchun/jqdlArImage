         * InputPlugins can be used to provide custom image data that is then processed and or rendered by the Wikitude SDK.
         * To decide whenever or not the Wikitude SDK should render the given input frame, use the ::requestsInputFrameRendering method.
         * In case the Wikitude SDK takes care of rendering, the memory is managed 100% by the Wikitude SDK internally and no additional code needs to be written. Just make sure that the std::shared_ptr has an appropriate deleter set (Please refer to our examples on how to do so).
         *
         * If ::requestsInputFrameRendering returns false, the Wikitude SDK still tries to manage the input frame data as good as possible, meaning that the input frame data should be retrieved through the ::getPresentableInputFrameData method.
         * This method always returns the input frame data that was processed most recently and is therefore the prefered data to render. If the input frame data is retrieved using this method, the SDK manages again all the memory related operations internally.
         * There might be cases where this is not the desired behaviour. In that case developer can override ::prepareRenderingOfInputFrame and set the managedFromOutside_ flag to true. Doing so will completely turn off any memory management in the background and developer are responsible for making sure that the input frame data, that was given with a certain id, is accessible until it's id was given in a call to ::prepareRenderingOfInputFrame.
